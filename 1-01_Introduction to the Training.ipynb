    "This course has been designed to introduce Python in a way that means you can quickly get started with data analysis, building on your R knowledge. This includes functions for importing, manipulating and visualising data as well as some basic statistical analysis. With the emphasis on using Python for these tasks there will be a number of features of Python that would be taught in a typical programming course that we will not cover, including some of Python's in-built objects and their methods, working with matrices and arrays in NumPy and conditional flow and function writing. Where appropriate the material includes notes for further reference."
